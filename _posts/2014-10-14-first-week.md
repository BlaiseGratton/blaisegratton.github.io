<h4><em>faciendum non legendum</em></h4>

&ldquo;Don&apos;t read about it, do it.&rdquo; This phrase affected me the most on the first day of class during John Wark&apos;s opening remarks to the cohort. It&apos;s deceptively simple yet contains the secret to success. 

The last few years of my life, I have been mainly a reader. There is nothing outright wrong with this in and of itself; academia revolves around the accumulation of knowledge and familiarization with topics through reading. But in the world of coding, reading about something means almost nothing if you can&apos;t implement it. 

The past week alone has more than proved this to me. Retention of something is very difficult if I don&apos;t try it to see if it actually works and if I actually understand it. It sometimes feels like I have to force myself to &ldquo;do it&rdquo; rather than just read about it, but making a habit of this -- or even a reflex -- would be one of the most valuabe things for me to develop right now.
